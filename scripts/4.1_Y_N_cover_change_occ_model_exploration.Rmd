# Introduction

This markdown outlines the process of modelling the number of occurrence records after a land cover change in relation to land cover changes (Y/N), time and SSB ID, without and with an offset.

The models ran as part of this are as follows:

| Model Name                            | Interaction?                | Marginal Value |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| YN_model1_SSB_interaction             | cover_change \* time_period | 0.001          |
| YN_model2_SSB_no_interaction          | cover_change + time_period  | 0.001          |
| YN_model3_SSB_interaction_0.1_offset  | cover_change \* time_period | 0.1            |
| YN_model4_SSB_interaction_0.01_offset | cover_change \* time_period | 0.01           |
