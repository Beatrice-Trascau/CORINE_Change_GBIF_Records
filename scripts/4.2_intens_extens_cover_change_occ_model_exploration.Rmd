# **Introduction**

This markdown outlines the process of modelling the number of species occurrence records in relation to land cover changes, time and SSB ID. Here, land cover changes are categorised as representing either a form of intensification or extensification of land-use.

The models variants ran as part of this are as follows:

```{r library load, include = FALSE}
library(here)
library(dplyr)
library(DHARMa)
library(ggplot2)
```

| Model Name                             | Interaction?                | Marginal Value |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| IntensExtens_model1_SSB_interaction    | cover_change \* time_period | 0.001          |
| IntensExtens_model2_SSB_no_interaction | cover_change + time_period  | 0.001          |
| IntensExtens_model3_SSB_0.1_offset     | cover_change \* time_period | 0.1            |
| IntensExtens_model4_SSB_0.01_offset    | cover_change \* time_period | 0.01           |
