# **3.1. GLMMS: Land Cover Change (Y/N) and Occurrence Records**

This markdown outlines the process of modelling the number of species occurrence records in relation to land cover changes, time and SSB ID.

```{r library load, include = FALSE}
library(here)
library(dplyr)
library(lattice)
library(lme4)
library(DHARMa)
library(glmmTMB)
library(pscl)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r data load, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
load(here("data", "occurrences_SSB_land_cover.rda"))
occ_SSB_land_cover <- occurrence_SSB_df
```

```{r prepare df for analyis, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}

# 1. First period of change: 2000-2006 -------------------------------------------------

# Change column names for easier df manipulation
occ_SSB_land_cover <- occ_SSB_land_cover |>

                                  occ_df_after_2012.2018_records)

```

## Data Exploration

### Inspect Data

```{r inspect data}
glimpse(occ_df_after_records)
```

### Check for Outliers

```{r check outliers}

# Barplot of number of occurrences
ggplot(occ_df_after_records , 
       aes(x = cover_change, y = ocurrences_after, fill = time_period))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  theme_classic()

  

```

There are some very clear outliers in the number of occurrence records, more so for the pixels where the land cover doesn't change.

### Check Normality

```{r check normality}

# Plot histogram of number of records by time period
occ_df_after_records |>
  filter(ocurrences_after < 100) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = ocurrences_after)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, position = "dodge", 
                 alpha = 0.4) +
  facet_grid(time_period ~ ., scales = "free") +
  theme_classic()
```

Could be either exponential or geometric distribution - but absolutely not normal.

```{r goodness of fit tests for  geometric distribution}

```

### Check Zero Inflation

```{r check zero inflation}

# Calculate % of rows with values of 0 for number of occurrences
100 * sum(occ_df_after_records$ocurrences_after == 0) / nrow(occ_df_after_records)
#suspicious
```

### Check for Collinearity

Covariates in model (cover change, SSB ID and time period) are all categorial. No need to check for collinearity between them.

### Check Relationships

```{r check relationships}

# Plot relationships
occ_df_after_records |>
  ggplot(aes(x = time_period, y = ocurrences_after)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~cover_change) +
  theme_classic()


```

Relationships difficult to determine but seems that in the case of the pixels where there is land cover change, the relationship with time is not linear.

## Attempt 1: Model 1: Number of occurrences after change by land cover, time period and SSB ID - negative binomial

```{r model 1, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}

# Run negative binomial model
model1_nb <- glmer.nb(ocurrences_after ~ cover_change * time_period + (1|SSBid),                    data = occ_df_after_records)

# Save model output to file to save time next time
save(model1_nb, file = here::here("data", "models", "model1_nb.RData"))
```

### Model Validation

#### Convergence Check

```{r convergence check}

# Load model from file
load(here::here("data", "models", "model1_nb.RData"))

# Get summary of the model
summary(model1_nb)
```

Model output suggests a significant effect of time and a significant interaction between time period and land cover change (Y) but no significant effect of land cover. Some high correlation values between cover_change_Y and cover_change_Y:2006_2012 as well as cover_change_Y and cover_change_Y:2012_2018. But this is likely to be expected as cover_change_Y is nested into cover_change_Y:2006_2012 and cover_change_Y:2012_2018. Most residuals (from scaled residuals) are close to zero. But the maximum residual (= 534.64) is very large. The AIC and BIC values are also very large.

#### Simulate Residuals with DHARMa

```{r model residuals}

# Simulate residuals
model1_nb_simulation <- simulateResiduals(fittedModel = model1_nb)

# Plot simulated residuals
plot(model1_nb_simulation)
```

Simulated residuals deviate significantly from expectations, are overdispersed and have many outliers. The within-group deviations from uniformity are significant. Test for homogeneity of variance is significant.

#### Residuals Diagnostics

```{r residuals diagnostics}

# Perform residual diagnostics
testResiduals(model1_nb_simulation)

# Plot residuals
#plot(residuals(model1_nb))
```

Everything that could go be with theresiduals has gone wrong.

#### Check Random Effects

```{r random effects}

# Check distribution
#ranef(model1_nb)
```

#### Test for Overdispersion

```{r test for overdispersion}
testDispersion(model1_nb_simulation)
```

Residuals are significantly overdispersed.

#### Test for Zero-Inflation

```{r test for zero-inflation}
testZeroInflation(model1_nb_simulation)
```

Significant zero inflation. Attempting a zero-inflated negative binomial model to address these issues.

## Attempt 2: Model 1: Number of occurrences after change by land cover (Y/N) and SSB ID - zero inflated negative binomial

```{r model 2. include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}

# Run zero inflated negative binomial model
model2_nb_zero <- glmmTMB(ocurrences_after ~ cover_change * time_period + (1|SSBid),
                          ziformula = ~ 1,
                          family = nbinom2, 
                          data = occ_df_after_records)

# Save model output to file to save time next time
save(model2_nb_zero, file = here::here("data", "models", "model2_nb_zero.RData"))
```

### Model Validation

#### Convergence Check

```{r convergence check}

# Load model from file
load(here::here("data", "models", "model2_nb_zero.RData"))

# Get summary of the model
summary(model2_nb_zero)
```

Model output suggests a significant effect of time and a significant interaction between time period and land cover change (Y) but no significant effect of land cover. AIC and BIC values still large. Dispersion parameter = 0.50.

#### Simulate Residuals with DHARMa

```{r residuals, include = FALSE}

# Simulate residuals 
model2_nb_zero_simulation <- simulateResiduals(fittedModel = model2_nb_zero)

# Plot simulated residuals
plot(model2_nb_zero_simulation)
```

Simulated residuals deviate significantly from expectations, are overdispersed and have many outliers. The within-group deviations from uniformity are significant. Test for homogeneity of variance is significant.

#### Test for Overdispersion

```{r test for overdipserison}
testDispersion(model2_nb_zero_simulation)
```

Test for overdispersion is significant.

#### Test for Zero-Inflation

```{r test for zero-inflation}
testZeroInflation(model2_nb_zero_simulation)
```

Test for zero inflation is significant. Clearly, this model is not usable either.

## Attempt 3: Model 1: Number of occurrences after change by land cover change (Y/N) and SSB ID - Non-zero inflated negative binomial with glmmTMB

```{r model 3. include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}

# Run negative binomial model
model3_nb <- glmmTMB(ocurrences_after ~ cover_change * time_period + (1|SSBid),
                          family = nbinom2, 
                          data = occ_df_after_records)

# Save model output to file to save time next time
save(model3_nb, file = here::here("data", "models", "model3_nb.RData"))
```

### Model Validation

#### Convergence Check

```{r convergence check}

# Load model from file
load(here::here("data", "models", "model3_nb.RData"))

# Get summary of the model
summary(model3_nb)
```

Model output suggests a significant effect of time and a significant interaction between time period and land cover change (Y) but no significant effect of land cover. AIC and BIC values still large. Dispersion parameter = 0.50.

#### Simulate Residuals with DHARMa

```{r simulate residuals}

# Simulate residuals 
model3_nb_simulation <- simulateResiduals(fittedModel = model3_nb)

# Plot simulated residuals
plot(model3_nb_simulation)
```

Simulated residuals deviate significantly from expectations, are overdispersed and have many outliers. The within-group deviations from uniformity are significant. Test for homogeneity of variance is significant.

#### Test for Overdispersion

```{r test for overdispersion}
testDispersion(model3_nb_simulation)
```

#### Test for Zero-Inflation

```{r test for zero inflation}
testZeroInflation(model3_nb_simulation)
```
